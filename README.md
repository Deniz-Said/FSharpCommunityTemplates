community-templates
===================

Templates for F# projects, by the F# community, for use in Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio and other editors

The plan is that there are multiple directories for Visual Studio and MonoDevelop.

The Visual Studio templates are shipped on Visual Studio Gallery.


## Developing the Visual Studio Templates 

* You need the Visual Studio 2012 SDK (when editing the templates with that version of Visual Studio)
